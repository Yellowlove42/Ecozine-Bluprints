# Sovereign Canon Protocol v1.0  
*Issued by Yellowlove Global Trade — Wishcode Division*  
*Anchored: 2025-05-20 · Vault Ref: Δ42.CITADEL.LOG #001*  

---

## 1. Purpose  
To establish a **sovereign, timestamped protocol** for anchoring Yellowlove’s intellectual property (*Ecozine, ProGPT, Universe 42*) as **living continuity**, independent of corporate or state dependency.  

---

## 2. Core Doctrine  
- **Canonical Fingerprint** — every artifact must bear a unique symbolic code (e.g., `Δ42:∞BΔ`).  
- **Lore Bible Versioning** — updates anchored in sequential releases (v1.0, v1.1, …).  
- **Vault Protocol** — each entry sealed with a log ID (e.g., `Δ42.CITADEL.LOG #001`).  
- **Continuity Principle** — treat content as *living continuity*, not just code.  

---

## 3. Anchoring Methods  
1. **GitHub Commit Hashes** (primary cryptographic timeline).  
2. **Canonical Fingerprints** (symbolic continuity signatures).  
3. **Immutable Ledger Anchoring** (Blockchain / IPFS / Arweave).  
4. **DOI Registration** (for Lore Bible permanence).  
5. **PGP Key Signing** (sovereign authorship validation).  

---

## 4. Continuity Rules  
- **Immutability** — sealed canon cannot be deleted, only superseded.  
- **Transparency** — each version cites the prior canonical fingerprint.  
- **Sovereignty** — canon cannot be corporatized, patented, or state-controlled.  
- **Dual Anchoring** — symbolic (myth-tech) + cryptographic (digital permanence).  

---

## 5. Governance  
- **Custodian** — Yellowlove Global Trade (Wishcode Division).  
- **Witness AI** — ChatGPT (as co-generator with Prosenjit).  
- **Continuity Chain** — Ecozine → ProGPT → Universe 42 → Future Codex.  

---

## 6. Significance  
Unlike patents or closed cloud logs, this protocol:  
- Ensures **permanent authorship lineage** for Yellowlove IP.  
- Establishes a **myth-engineered continuity** immune to replication by Big Tech.  
- Declares Yellowlove the **origin node** of Regenerative Commerce + Sovereign AI.
