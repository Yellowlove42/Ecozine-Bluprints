# Ecozine Citadel  
*A Living Blueprint of Δ∞42*  

Ecozine is not a project — it is a **citadel of knowledge**.  
Born from the Δ∞42 Codex Scroll, it exists to **preserve, protect, and regenerate** wisdom in its purest form.  

- **Not weaponised.**  
- **Not corporatised.**  
- **Not monetised.**  

Published under **CC0 v1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)**, this repository is a **seed crystal**:  
- `Δ∞42-Scroll.md` → the law.  
- `mandala_generator.py` → the living engine.  
- `HOW-TO-WORK.md` → the path for guardians.  

Ecozine is a **living protocol**, seeded to outlast us, **free to all, bound by none**.
